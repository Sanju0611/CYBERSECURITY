# CYBERSECURITY
Cyber Security Projects Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of hands-on cybersecurity and ethical hacking projects completed by Sanjana Inchalmath as part of academic and practical exploration. Each project demonstrates real-world skills in areas such as penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, network scanning, and secure cloud configurations.

üìÅ Project Overviews
1. Network Security Consultant (CAPSTONE 3)
A simulated consulting role addressing practical cloud and SSL/TLS issues. The tasks include:
Resolving SSL certificate and browser trust issues.
Configuring secure inbound rules for cloud-based VMs (SSH, RDP, HTTP/S).
Designing VPN connectivity solutions for different user roles using WireGuard and SSTP.


2. Penetration Testing Report (CAPSTONE 4)
A step-by-step penetration test with mitigation strategies for:
DOM-Based XSS Attacks ‚Äì with CSP and encoding.
Directory Traversal Attacks ‚Äì via input validation and path restrictions.
SQL Injection ‚Äì prevented using prepared statements and limited DB permissions.
Also includes Nmap-based active reconnaissance commands.


3. Nmap Scanning Report
Comprehensive usage of the Nmap tool including:
Port scanning (TCP & UDP)
OS fingerprinting and version detection
Vulnerability detection (using --script vuln)
Aggressive scanning insights and potential risks
Detailed comparisons between TCP vs UDP scans


4. Ethical Hacking Project Report
Vulnerability Assessment & Penetration Testing (VAPT) performed on:
Windows 10 system
Debian Linux system

Key techniques:
Network scanning via Nmap
Vulnerability scanning via Nessus
Documentation of threats like SMB and Apache vulnerabilities
Suggested mitigation: firewalls, patching, and password policy enhancements


5. Application and Web Application Security Demo
A walkthrough of common SQL injection scenarios using vulnerable queries:
Basic queries and table alterations
Injection examples like 'OR '1'='1, DROP TABLE, and privilege escalation
Useful for learning how improperly sanitized inputs can compromise applications


üõ† Tools Used
Nmap
Burp Suite / OWASP ZAP
Kali Linux
Nessus
SQL queries (for injection demos)

üìå Learning Outcomes
Identifying real-world attack vectors
Applying layered defense mechanisms
Understanding secure network configurations
Conducting vulnerability scans and interpreting reports
